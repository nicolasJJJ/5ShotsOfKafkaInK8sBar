# goal
The main goal is to publish some recreatives projects for me to learn, exchange with people knowing more than me and maybe offer me new opportunities for data engineering projects.

The second goal is to sh*t the mouth of an SIGINT officer with better skills than me with his "Bambee" sweater. WTf, a Bambee sweater !! It's time to show who's on the top of food chain.

## Configs folder
Contains configs read by microK8S to start the services, pdbs, deployments and all.
